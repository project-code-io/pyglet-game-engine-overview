# Pyglet 

This repository is part of a youtube video, in which I look into pyglet as a 
2D game engine for python.

## Running the code

You'll need to install pyglet to the code here. You can do this from the
`requirements.txt` with the following command. Needless to say, but you'll
need python and pip installed on your machine.


```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you navigate to each subdirectory to run the code, so it can find
the code in relation to the directory you run it from.

i.e.

### GOOD

```
$ cd loop
$ python move.py
```

### BAD
```
$ python loop/move.py
```
